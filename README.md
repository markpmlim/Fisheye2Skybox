## Convert a Single FishEye image to render a Skybox


This project attempts to project a single fisheye image as skybox.

We expect single fisheye image to be a perfect circular inscribed circle.

To compare the code in the fragment shader with those listed in the article posted at weblink 2)

```glsl
    float r = 2.0 * atan(length(n.xy), abs(n.z)) / PI;
```

is equivalent to the lines

    float phi = atan(length(n.xy), abs(n.z));
    float r = 2.0 * phi / PI;

where the aperture (FOV) is taken to have a  value of Ï€ which might not be the case in a real fisheye camera lens.

And the line

```glsl

    vec2 uv = vec2(cos(theta), sin(theta)) * r * 0.5 + vec2(0.5);
```
can be re-written as:

```glsl

    float u = r * cos(theta);
    float v = r * sin(theta);

    vec2 uv = vec2(u, v) * 0.5 + vec2(0.5);
```

A single fisheye image can not be used to project a 360 degree view of the environment. A dual fisheye image is required.
